# Let's Make Some Noise

## What is That?
It's a website that I've used for presenting my recent tech lunch talk about perlin noise and terrain generation.

## How to use it?
1. You need to install dependencies via yarn: `yarn install`
2. Compile the assets: `yarn run webpack`
3. Start a server: `node app.js`
4. Locate the server address and use the following keys:
```
  "n" - Next slide
  "p" - Previous slide
  "r" - Rebuild with random seed. (Only available on slides 22, 23, 24)
```
